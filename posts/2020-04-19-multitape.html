<section>
<p>Consider a Turing machine that takes as input, strings from the alphabet <span class="math inline">\(\{0, 1, +\}\)</span> of the form <span class="math inline">\(s_1+s_2\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(s_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(s_2\)</span> are strings of 0s and 1s and represent numbers in binary, and outputs the sum of the two numbers represented. One can do this on an ordinary Turing machine, but it would be simpler if we had three tapes, so that we could write <span class="math inline">\(s_1\)</span> on one of them, <span class="math inline">\(s_2\)</span> on the other, and the partial sum on the third. It would then help to focus on one character from each of these tapes to add one digit at a time.</p>
<p>While any computation that such so called multitape Turing machines can perform can be simulated on a single tape Turing machine, it is often easier to design a Turing machine if we allow more than one tape, and the, and then the design can be converted into a design of a single tape Turing machine by the standard method described below. This is similar to the situation with finite state automata, where we could first design the more flexible non-deterministic automaton and then convert it to a deterministic one by a standard procedure.</p>
<h2 id="the-formal-definition">The formal definition</h2>
<p>A multitape Turing machine has more than one but finitely many tapes and each of its tapes has its own head. Formally, it consists of a five tuple, <span class="math display">\[(Q, \Sigma, \Gamma, \delta, q_{accept}, q_{reject})\]</span> where every symbol means the same as before except the transition function, <span class="math display">\[\delta : Q \times \Gamma^k \to Q \times \Gamma^k \times \{L, R, S\}^k\]</span></p>
<p>Here, the direction <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> stands for “Stationary” and means that the head should not be moved during that step. Since this machine has <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> heads, one for each of the <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> tapes, <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span> takes as input the current state, and the <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> letters of the tape alphabet <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span> under each of these <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> heads, and outputs the new state to shift into, the new characters to replace the ones under the <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> heads, and the directions to move each head. For example, if</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\delta(q_2, (0, 1, 0)) = (q_5, (1, 1, 1), (L, S, R))\]</span></p>
<p>it means that if the current state is <span class="math inline">\(q_2\)</span>, if the letter under the first head is 0, under the second is 1, and under the third one is 0, then replace the character under the first head (i.e. on the first tape) by 1, leave the character under the second head (on the second tape) unchanged, and change the character under the third head (on the third tape) to 0. Also, shift the first head left, the third right, but leave the second unchanged, and switch to state <span class="math inline">\(q_5\)</span>. It halts when it reaches either an accept state (i.e. <span class="math inline">\(q_{accept}\)</span>) or a reject state (i.e. <span class="math inline">\(q_{reject}\)</span>), just as an ordinary Turing machine does.</p>
<p>Can a multitape Turing machine do more than a single tape one? The answer is no, although it may perform the same computation more efficiently. The reason is simple: we can simulate the working of any <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> shaped Turing machine using a Turing machine with only one tape.</p>
<h3 id="simulating-the-tapes">Simulating the tapes</h3>
<p>Each tape of the multitape Turing machine is infinite but at any given instant, only a finite part of the tape is used. Therefore, during any stage of the computation, the current contents of all the tapes can be written one after the other, using <code>#</code> as a separator, on a single tape, as shown in the table below.</p>
<p>We need a way to “mark” the <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> characters that are under the heads. However, each cell of a tape can hold only one character. One way to do that is to have marked versions for each letter of the alphabet. So if the alphabet is <span class="math inline">\(\{0, 1\}\)</span>, we must also include <span class="math inline">\(\{\hat{0},\hat{1},\hat{\sqcup}\}\)</span> so that <span class="math inline">\(\hat{0}\)</span> would be the marked version of 0, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{1}\)</span> would be the marked version of 1, and <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\sqcup}\)</span> would be the marked version of the blank character. It is important to realize that each marked character is a <em>single</em> character and not a combination of two characters!</p>
<p>For example, the following tape simulates the three configurations of each of the three tapes of a mult-tape machine, each separated by a <code>#</code>. The first head of the original machine is over a 0, which was the third character on the first tape; the second head is over a 1, which is also the third character on the second tape; the third head is over a 0, which happens to be the first character on the tape.</p>

<p>To simulate the computation, a shift of head would involve replacing the “head” version of the character with its ordinary one, and replacing the ordinary character with a head version. If the head is to move right to a previously unwritten cell of one of the tapes, then in the simulated version, one would need to insert a blank character before the separator <code>#</code>, which would require everything to the right of it to be shifted one character to the right.</p>
<h2 id="the-steps">The steps</h2>
<h4 id="section"></h4>
<ul>
<li>Step 1: Find out what is “under the heads”</li>
<li>Step 2: Apply <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span> to know the output</li>
<li>Step 3: Update the simulated tapes</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="states">States</h4>
<p>Let us first list the information that we need to remember while sweeping between cells on the tape:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The number of the simulated tape in focus. So define, <span class="math display">\[N := \{1, 2, \ldots, k\}\]</span>.</li>
<li>The current state, i.e. element of <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>. But in the beginning, we may have nothing. So, <span class="math display">\[\tilde{Q} = Q \cup \{\text{Nothing}\}\]</span></li>
<li>The characters under the simulated heads, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma^k\)</span></li>
<li>The output of <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span>, i.e. <span class="math display">\[Y:=Q \times \Gamma^k \times \{L, R, S\}^k \cup \{\text{Nothing}\}\]</span></li>
</ol>
<p>So we take the set of states <span class="math display">\[Q' \subset S \times \tilde{Q} \times \tilde{\Gamma}^k \times Y\]</span>. Once again, it is a subset, because not all of them are required. In fact, all elements from the <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> component are already determined by the previous two components.</p>
<h5 id="example-noting-the-tape-number">Example: noting the tape number</h5>
<p>For instance, this part of the transition function represents the recording of the current simulated tape that the head is on. Therefore, it updates the tape number when it crosses <code>#</code> but alters no other entry of the state. It continues moving right. <span class="math display">\[
\begin{split}
((\text{Step 0}, {n}, q_i, (0,1, \text{Nothing}, \ldots), \text{Nothing}),\  {{\tt \#}}) &amp; \to \\ ((\text{Step 0}, {n+1}, q_i, (0, 1, \text{Nothing}, \ldots), \text{Nothing}), {{\tt \#}}, \text{R})) &amp;
\end{split}
\]</span></p>
<p>Remember that the variable <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is only to express it in a more compact form. While constructing the transition table, we need to replace <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> by its <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> possibilites and therefore we would have (the relevant entries are in bold):</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{split}
((\text{Step 0}, \mathbf{1}, q_i, (0,1, \text{Nothing}, \ldots), \text{Nothing}),\  {{\tt \#}}) &amp; \to \\ ((\text{Step 0}, \mathbf{2}, q_i, (0, 1, \text{Nothing}, \ldots), \text{Nothing}), {{\tt \#}}, \text{R})) &amp;
\end{split}
\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{split}
((\text{Step 0}, \mathbf{2}, q_i, (0,1, \text{Nothing}, \ldots), \text{Nothing}),\  {{\tt \#}}) &amp; \to \\ ((\text{Step 0}, \mathbf{3}, q_i, (0, 1, \text{Nothing}, \ldots), \text{Nothing}), {{\tt \#}}, \text{R})) &amp;
\end{split}
\]</span></p>
<p>etc.</p>
<p>However, there are finitely many simualted tapes, so this will account for only finitely many rows of the transition table (the columns are of course finite because they correspond to characters from the alphabet).</p>
<h5 id="example-noting-the-characters-under-the-heads">Example: Noting the characters under the heads</h5>
<p>This part of the transition function represents the recording of the character under <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>th simulated head. Remember that the <em>A</em> character represents the character 0 with a sumulated head pointing at it (as opposed to an ordinary 0 which represents a character with no head over it). Similarly a <em>B</em> representes the character 1 with a simulated head over it. Note that since the state records the current simulated tape under focus as <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, the character under the head is recorded in the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>th entry of the inner tuple from <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma^k\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{split}
((\text{Step 0}, \mathbf{n}, q_i, (0,1, \text{Nothing}, \ldots), \text{Nothing}),\  {\mathbf{\hat{0}}}) &amp; \to \\ ((\text{Step 0}, n, q_i, (0, {1}, \ldots, \mathbf{0}, \ldots), \text{Nothing}), {\hat{0}}, \text{R})) &amp;
\end{split}
\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{split}
((\text{Step 0}, \mathbf{n}, q_i, (0,1, \text{Nothing}, \ldots), \text{Nothing}),\  {\mathbf{\hat{1}}}) &amp; \to \\ ((\text{Step 0}, n, q_i, (0, 1, \ldots, \mathbf{1}, \ldots), \text{Nothing}), {\hat{1}}, \text{R})) &amp;
\end{split}
\]</span></p>
<p>Once again, the variable <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> above will be replaced with each of the <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> possible values that represent the precise tape from among the <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> possibilites. So this part of the transition function will account for <span class="math inline">\(2k\)</span> rows of the transition table.</p>
<p>The step that enlarges a simulated tape by shifting, requires a “subroutine”.</p>
<p>You can do the rest as an exercise and convince yourself that, even if it is tedious, it is straightforward to come up with the transition table that will specify a single tape Turing machine to simulate a given multitape one.</p>
