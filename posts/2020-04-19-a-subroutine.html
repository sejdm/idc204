<p>In the last example, we saw how viewing states as tuples simplified the process of designing a Turing machine by exposing the state as a combination of various components, including the step of the algorithm and memory. Similarly, we can simplify the process of designing also by breaking down the algorithm broadly into “subroutines” and then focussing on each subroutine at a time. Each subroutine may in turn be a a combination of subourtines and so on. Together with the method of representing states as tuples, it allows one to specify a Turing machine by merely describing broad steps of an algorithm, if each of the steps are straightforward or previously worked out subroutines.</p>
<p>As an example, assume that step 6 of a certain algorithm was “shift all the characters, beginning with the current head position, one cell to the right.” We have already designed a Turing machine which shifts all characters one cell to the right. It has a start state <span class="math inline">\(q_0\)</span>, some other states <span class="math inline">\(q_1, q_1'\)</span> etc., accept state <span class="math inline">\(q_{accept}\)</span>, and reject state <span class="math inline">\(q_{reject}\)</span>. So we can think of the states to run this as a subroutine as <span class="math inline">\((\text{Step 6}, q_0)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\((\text{Step 6}, q_1)\)</span>, etc. If we denote the transition function for shifting by <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span> and our transition function by <span class="math inline">\(\delta'\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\delta(q, c) = (q', c', d)\)</span> then the relevant part of <span class="math inline">\(\delta'\)</span> will be defined <span class="math inline">\(\delta'( (\text{Step 6}, q) = ((\text{Step 6}, q'), c', d)\)</span> as long as <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> is not a halt state. If it is a halt state, then instead of terminating, <span class="math inline">\(\delta'\)</span> will transition to the step or state that is supposed to transition into after the subroutine ends. It may make a choice and transition into one or another state depending on whether the subroutine finished with an accept or reject state. For example, if the subroutine was testing equality between two substrings, then if that is correct (i.e. the subroutine halted in an accept state) it will have to transition into the relevant state.</p>
